| Depth First Search   | `O(n)` \| `O(V+E)` | `O(V)`                 |
| Breadth First Search | `O(n)` \| `O(V+E)` | `O(V)`                 |


n - number of elements in the list/nodes in tree \
V - number of nodes in graph \
E - number of edges in graph \
_\* Assumes input is sorted_ \
_\*\* Former for iterative, latter for recursive implementation_
